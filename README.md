# Cell Profiler - FIJI Bridge + LIMA Workflow Helper

This repository contains jar files which handles .cppipe workflows (CellProfiler 3, version from Feb 2019) in Java.

It contains SciJava Commands and Displays which can open, modify, and save such workflows.

Also, workflows containing duplicated modules can be auto-generated based on keywords.

This repository has been desgined to be able to perform the LiMA pipeline (https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2016.059) in the EPFL BIOP Imaging Facility.

As such the generation module command is tweaked, and could not work appropriately for other purpose.
